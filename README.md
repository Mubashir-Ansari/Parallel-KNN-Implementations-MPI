# Parallel-KNN-Implementations-MPI
The message passing interface (MPI) is a standardized means of exchanging messages between multiple computers running a parallel program across distributed memory.
The k-nearest neighbors algorithm uses a very simple approach to perform classification. When tested with a new example, it looks through the training data and finds the k training examples that are closest to the new example. It then assigns the most common class label (among those k-training examples) to the test example.
